                <div class="center-text"class="col-lg-12 test-center">I first started by downloading Prusa Slicer and my nametag files. This all went smoothly, and I edited my 3D print to have my name; once this was done, I sliced the print and exported it to a USD stick. Once I had my print on the stick, I filled out the "print job number form," got my number, and plugged my USB into the Prusa Mini+. At this point, I felt confident and thought I had done everything correctly, so I started my print. Unfortunately, only a couple minutes into the printing process, my print started to overlap on top of itself and completely messed up. This was unfortunate, but I thought it was an error with the print, so I cleaned up the messed-up print and tried again on another machine. Again, the print got messed up, which told me that It was, in fact, an issue with my print file and not the machines. 

So, I started from zero and completely restarted the process. This time, I was more hesitant to begin my new NameTag print even though I was confident I'd set up the USB stick properly. Fortunately, the first stage of the print came out well, so I switched the filament color for the second half of the print. Once the print was done, I popped it off the printing plate, too, and was happy to see it turned out almost perfect despite a couple of minor print errors in the letters of my name. 

This process was slightly trickier than expected, but it went smoothly once I got the hang of the software and machinery.

Because the web is so thin and must be printed mid-air, I expected it to droop and not connect properly. Furthermore, I thought there would be no chance the web could hold the whole spider. 

When printing, the web deformed and fell apart because it had no support. Despite this, however, I was surprised to see that the spider came out surprisingly well and could still be supported by the messed-up web. The Prusa Mini+ surpassed my expectations, and the print came out well despite the apparent error of trying to print the web without support.

I also learned that the 3MF file, compared to the STL, is more advanced and allows for better texture and complex geometries, whereas STL files are best for simple 3D models but lack advanced features. 

In conclusion, I learned about the machinery's limits and the various advances and drawbacks of  3MF versus STL files.

Not only was I able to create a design that would have my keys attached to the spinner, but it still spins on my finger with my keys attached. If I wanted to optimize this design further, I could've shortened the connector between my keys and the chain and made the connector larger so it could be put on my keys more easily and spin smoother. As for my experience with remixing this design in TinkerCad instead of Fusion, I would say that TinkerCad was a lot more intuitive and easier to use. For a simple design like this one, I prefer TinkerCad, but I felt like as the complexity of my designs ramps up, my needs won't be met with TinkerCad, and I'll need all the complexities found in Fusion. Overall, this process was a good introduction to Fusion for me and forced me to think outside of the box when it came to remixing a design.

                <div class="center-text"class="col-lg-12 test-center">For Project 3, we were first asked to create our alarm clocks. The first step in this process was learning how to Solder our electronic alarm clock kits. While it took me about an hour to truly get the hang of sauntering, I started to fly through the process once I did. Then, once I finished Solder and assembling the alarm clock, I needed to take detailed measurements of all its dimensions for the next step, which was designing an enclosure for the clock and battery pack. I felt confident with my first design, but as soon as I took it off the print, I could tell I had a couple of significant flaws. The first of which was that the sliding lid mechanism didn't even fit and was, therefore, a complete failure. Secondly, while the interior space of the design was the right size for the battery pack, the clock, which was smaller, was too loose and would slide around inside. To fix the first issue, I made the sliding lid thinner so it could fit, and for the loose clock, it took a little more trial and error. I eventually figured out that I could make one-half of the box interior smaller than the other so both the clock and battery pack could fit snugly.

                <div class="center-text"class="col-lg-12 test-center">Secondly, we were asked to create a finger joint box to hold the clock. I spent much more time learning how to create the finger joint box than actually making it. Once I understood how to design one face of the box, the rest became extremely intuitive, and I finished my first design very quickly using the mirror tool in fusion to create a straightforward box design. Because I made sure to measure all the dimensions of the box precisely in fusion, I expected this first design to fit the clock very well, but unfortunately, this was not the case. In the first laser cut, I had forgotten to take into account that the plywood was three millimeters thin instead of 2 millimeters like the walls of my 3D print had been. So, when it came time to assemble the first cut, it was apparent that the clock wouldn't fit inside. To try and fix this without completely remaking the design, we got creative and tried to sand down the pieces of plywood and the outside of the battery pack. Unfortunately, both of these methods failed, and I completely scratched the first design and made a new one except slightly larger to compensate for the three-millimeter plywood. Luckily, this design worked well and gave us a well-fitting finger-joint box for the alarm clock. This project was the most enjoyable for me so far because it introduced the most new learning components. This project taught me the most new skills, from learning to Solder electronics to using the laser cutter.
