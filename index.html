                <div class="center-text"class="col-lg-12 test-center">I first started by downloading Prusa Slicer and my nametag files. This all went smoothly, and I edited my 3D print to have my name; once this was done, I sliced the print and exported it to a USD stick. Once I had my print on the stick, I filled out the "print job number form," got my number, and plugged my USB into the Prusa Mini+. At this point, I felt confident and thought I had done everything correctly, so I started my print. Unfortunately, only a couple minutes into the printing process, my print started to overlap on top of itself and completely messed up. This was unfortunate, but I thought it was an error with the printer, so I cleaned up the messed-up print and tried again on another machine. Again, the print got messed up, which told me that It was, in fact, an issue with my print file and not the machines. 

So, I completely restarted the process. This time, I was more hesitant to begin my new NameTag print even though I was confident I'd set up the USB stick properly. Fortunately, the first stage of the print came out well, so I switched the filament color for the second half of the print. Once the print was done, I popped it off the printing plate, too, and was happy to see it turned out almost perfect despite a couple of minor print errors in the letters of my name. 

This process was slightly trickier than expected, but it went smoothly once I got the hang of the software and machinery.

                class="col-lg-12 test-center">For my torture test, I decided to print a spider whose body is entirely supported by a thin web. Because the web is so thin and must be printed mid-air, I expected it to droop and not connect properly. Furthermore, I thought there would be no chance that the web could hold the whole spider. 

When printing, the web deformed and fell apart because it had no support. Despite this, however, I was surprised to see that the spider came out surprisingly well and was still able to be supported by the messed-up web. The Prusa Mini+ surpassed my expectations, and the print came out well despite the apparent error of trying to print the web without support.

I also learned that the 3MF file, compared to the STL, is more advanced and allows for better texture and complex geometries, whereas STL files are best for simple 3D models but lack advanced features. 

In conclusion, I learned about the machinery's limits and the various advances and drawbacks of  3MF versus STL files.
